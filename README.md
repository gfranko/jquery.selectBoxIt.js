jquery.selectBoxIt.js - jQuery Select Box Plugin
------------------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js)

A jQuery plugin that progressively enhances an HTML Select Box into a single option dropdown list.  The dropdown list can be optionally styled with **Twitter Bootstrap**, **jQueryUI ThemeRoller**, or **jQuery Mobile**, optionally animated with **jQueryUI show/hide effects**, and works on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile browsers.

[Homepage](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/)

[Annotated Source Code](http://www.gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/docs/jQuery.selectBoxIt.html)

**Notable Features**

   - Styleable with Twitter Bootstrap, jQueryUI Themeroller, and jQuery Mobile

   - Supports Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile browsers

   - Supports all jQuery and jQueryUI show/hide effects (optional)

   - Supports all Twitter Bootstrap (Glyphicons) and jQueryUI/custom icons

   - Includes ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) support

   - Full keyboard search and navigation support

   - An event API triggered on the original select box element that calls the plugin

   - A method API providing methods to interact with the dropdown list (i.e. Search, Open, Disable, Set Options).

   - Passes jsHint with no errors

   - Selected, Disabled, and Optgroup Support

   - Easily extendable to allow developers to create new widgets

## Requirements
jQuery 1.8.3+ (It is always recommended to use the latest version of jQuery)

jQueryUI Widget Factory 1.10.0+ (It is always recommended to use the latest version of the jQueryUI Widget Factory)

## Desktop Browser Support
IE8+, Firefox 4+, Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 11+ (Other browsers may work, but I did not test on them)

**Note:** The CSS3 `background-size` property is used for the icon images, which is only supported in IE9+

## Mobile/Tablet Browser Support
iOs 3+, Android 2.1+ (Other browsers may work, but I did not test on them)


## Unit Tests
All unit tests are written using the Jasmine Framework

## Contributing
Take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add Jasmine unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

If you plan to contribute to `SelectBoxIt` in the future, keep in mind that you should make sure your code passes the Grunt checks.

To set up the SelectBoxIt grunt/node.js dependencies, first make sure you have [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed, which is a headless browser. Unfortunately PhantomJS cannot be installed automatically.

Next, navigate to within the **jquery.selectBoxIt.js** folder and type `npm install' (this should install grunt and a few other node.js libraries).

Next, type `grunt`

**Note:** If you are on Windows, remember you need to run the grunt command using `grunt.cmd`.  Also, if you have trouble getting the Jasmine Unit Tests to work with PhantomJS 1.5 (the current release), install PhantomJS 1.3.

After you have verified your code, send a pull request to the `SelectBoxIt` dev branch.  After you send a pull request, you will hear back from me shortly after I review your code.

You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!

## Forking
If you find that you need a feature that SelectBoxIt does not currently support, either let me know via the SelectBoxIt issue tracker, or fork SelectBoxIt on Github and easily extend SelectBoxIt to create your own widget!

## Change Log

`3.7.0` - August 13, 2013

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a focus bug that prevented a drop down option to be selected if the drop down menu was open and the page was then scrolled.
- Fixed scroll list not closing bug [#196](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/196) [#191](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/191)
- Fixed incorrect Microsoft CSS prefix: [#195](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/195)
- Fixed max-width rendering for select boxes that are initially hidden: [#192](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/192)
- Fixed Native select box and accesibility bug: [#189](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/189)

**Improvements**
- ARIA support [#197](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/197)

`3.6.0` - June 23, 2013

**BREAKING CHANGES**
- jQuery v1.8.3 or greater is now required.  The reason for the bump is a jQuery bug associated with passing an array of jQuery objects to the `append()` method.  [#175](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/175)

- The `size` attribute is no longer supported.  You must now use the `data-size` attribute to specify size.  The reason for the change is because when an HTML select box has a `size` attribute, you cannot retrieve the value of the select box (terrible) [#170](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/170)

**New Options**
- `hideCurrent` - Hides the currently selected drop down option from the list. [#172](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/172)

**Bug Fixes**
- Prevent the `destroy` event from propagating to parent elements [#181](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/181)
- Fixed an irritating bug that did not allow an option to be selected after the drop down was open and the page was scrolled

**Improvements**
- Deferred objects/promises are now supported within the `populate` option and `add()` method.  This change makes it much easier to use the jQuery `ajax()` method to dynamically add options. [#171](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/171)
- When using the `showFirstOption` option with mobile/tablet browsers, the first drop down option will now be disabled.  Since hiding a select box option is not in the W3C specification, it will not yet be supported. [#179](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/179)
- On mobile/tablet browsers, the `option-click` event is now triggered along with the change event. [#184](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/184)
- Improved the `setOption()` and `setOptions()` methods to handle all option updates. [#185](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/185)

`3.5.0` - May 10, 2013

**New Options**
- `dynamicPositioning` - Determines whether or not the drop down list should fit inside it's viewport.

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed Firefox Keyboard Navigation Bug [#160](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/160)
- Fixed dynamic positioning bug: [#166](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/166)
- Fixed enable/disable bug: [#163](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/163)
- Fixed default text and selected bug: [#165](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/165)

- `size` - Support the `size` attribute to determine the maximum number of visible drop down list options that should be shown.  Possible values include `auto` or a number > 1
- Added the `data-preventclose` HTML5 data attribute to allow you to specify which option selections should not close the drop down

**New Methods**

- Fixed the jQueryUI Dark Themes bug [#148](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/148)

**Improvements**
- Improved event handling performance by switching to the jQuery `on()` method and adding event delegation instead of direct binding in a few places
- Now triggering the `change` event when using the **defaultText** option [#146](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/146)
- Improved the `dynamic positioning` logic to not set a `max-height` in unneccessary places

`3.3.0` - March 19, 2013

**New Options**
- `autoWidth` - Makes sure the width of the drop down is wide enough to fit all of the drop down options.  **BREAKING CHANGE** - This is now the default. [#129](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/129)
- `html` - Determines whether or not option text is rendered as html or as text.  [#136](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/136)

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed mobile positioning bug [#135](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/135)
- Fixed focusout bug [#133](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/133)
- Chopped text (the new autoWidth option is a fix for this) [#126](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/126)

**Improvements**
- Hide the original select box faster [#132](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/132)

`3.2.0` - February 28, 2013

**New Options**
- Added `copyClasses` option which allows the user to specify if native classes should be copied to the button, the container element, or neither.  For backwards compatibility, defaults to "button". [#124](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/89)

- Added a `nativeMousdown` option to allow the drop down to be opened programmatically using the mousedown event. Currently, the open event logic needs to be updated to allow this. [#89](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/89)

- Add a `customShowHideEvent` option to which prevents a drop down from opening on click or mousedown, which allows a user to open/close the drop down with a custom event handler. [#89](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/89)

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a dynamic positioning bug
- Fixed a bootstrap theme box-shadow bug
- Fixed a mobile webkit bug
- Made the refresh() method compatible with the native option [#125](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/125)
- Prevented the `open()`, and `close()` methods from opening the desktop drop down list with mobile devices

`3.1.0` - February 20, 2013

**IMPORTANT** - Only **pixel widths** for the drop down are guaranteed to work.  Do not use percentage based widths or `width:auto;`

- Added back the dynamic `max-width` CSS attribute for the drop down text to make sure even small select boxes would look correctly.

`3.0.0` - February 20, 2013

- **IMPORTANT** - Make sure to update the jQueryUI Widget Factory to **v1.0.0+**: The Widget Factory now requires you to access the plugin instance using `$("select").data("selectBox-selectBoxIt");`

- Fixed IE 8 bug from copying over all select box attributes to the new drop down [#95](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/95)

`2.8.0` - January 12, 2013

_IMPORTANT_: **Dropped IE7 support** - This does not mean new features will not work in IE7, but instead that they will not be tested in IE7.

- All attributes on the original select box and select box options are now being copied over to the new drop down.

`2.7.0` - January 11, 2013

- Refactored internal drop down DOM element property names.

`2.6.0` - January 8, 2013

- Added support for styling the currently `selected` drop down option via the **selectboxit-selected** CSS class [#86](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/86)

- Fixed `refresh()` method mobile bug [#68](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/68)

- Refactored and fixed bugs for SelectBoxIt internal event triggering:  All custom events now return an object containing both the currently selected select box and drop down options

`2.5.0` - January 6, 2013

**Default Behavior Change**

- SelectBoxIt will no longer select a drop down option (and trigger the change event on the original select box) when a user navigates to an option using the up and down arrow keys via the keyboard, or searches for an option using the keyboard.  An option will only be `selected` when a user clicks an option or presses the `enter` key when an option is actively "focused".  [#85](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/85)

- Added a new option, **aggressiveChange**, which _will_ select a drop down option (and trigger the change event on the original select box) when a user navigates to an option using the up and down arrow keys via the keyboard, or searchs for an option using the keyboard.

- There is now always an "active" class when drop down options are moused over.  [#84](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/issues/84)

`2.4.0` - January 2, 2013

- Added the **data-iconurl** HTML5 data attribute to support relative and absolute image url's

- Improved custom event handling.  The **moveDown**, **moveUp**, **search**, **option-click**, **disable-option**, and **enable-option** custom events now pass an object back in the second argument of the callback function event handler.  Within the _object.elem_ property, is the single select box option that was interacted with.

- Added Travis CI testing support

**Note:** If you are using Twitter Bootstrap as your theme, then it is recommended to upgrade to Twitter Bootstrap v2.2.0 or greater ()

- Added the **native** option: Allows you to trigger the native select box element when a user is interacting with the drop down

`2.0.0` - November 9th, 2012

- Greatly improved dynamic positioning.  SelectBoxIt now makes sure that the drop down list never runs off of the page (no matter how small the viewport is)

- Improved support for enclosing a drop down arrow inside of a box (by setting a border)

- Simplified mobile device checking for iOs, Android, Blackberry, Opera Mini, and Windows mobile devices (Removed the long regex supplied by [detectmobilebrowsers.com](http://www.detectmobilebrowsers.com))

`0.6.0` - May 3, 2012 [Documentation](http://gregfranko.com/blog/introducing-the-jquery-plugin-selectboxit/#using-icons)

- Added jQueryUI and custom icon support to allow icons to be used for the dropdown list and also alongside individual dropdown options.  You can specify the class names that you want to use to show the appropriate icon (set the background-image property inside of your CSS).  There are two ways to do this (HTML5 data attributes or SelectBoxIt options)

	* Added support for three new HTML5 data attributes to be used with the original select box element.  Use cases for each are described below.
		* data-icon - Specifies the custom or jQueryUI CSS classes you want to use to show icon images for the dropdown list and/or dropdown list individual options
		* data-downarrow - Specifies the custom or jQueryUI CSS classes you want to use to replace the default down arrow icon image
		* data-text - Specifies the custom text that you want to use for the dropdown list

`0.5.0` - April 29, 2012   **MAJOR REWRITE**

- `SelectBoxIt` has been rewritten using the `jQueryUI Widget Factory`!  This means that `SelectBoxIt` depends on both jQuery and the jQueryUI Widget Factory.  This also means that there are a few API changes that are not backwards compatible...
	* `getOption()`, `getOptions()`, and `create()` were all removed from the Method API
	* To use the custom pseudo selector, you must now use `$(":selectBox-selectBoxIt")`
