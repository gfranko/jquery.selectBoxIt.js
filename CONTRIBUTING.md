Contributing to jquery.selectBoxIt.js
=====================================
- Take care to maintain the existing coding style. 
- Add Jasmine unit tests for any new or changed functionality. 
- Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

If you plan to contribute to SelectBoxIt in the future, keep in mind that you 
should make sure your code **passes the Grunt checks**.  This requires having a
complete build environment as detailed below.

After you have verified your code, send a pull request to the **SelectBoxIt dev 
branch**.  After you send a pull request, you will hear back from me shortly after 
I review your code.

You'll find source code in the 'src' subdirectory.

Developers might want to start with the 
[annotated source code](http://www.gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/docs/jQuery.selectBoxIt.html).

## Unit Tests
All unit tests are written using the [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) Framework.  
See the linked pages for a great introduction.

## Setting up the SelectBoxIt build environment

_Note_ that you don't actually need to do a build to use SelectBoxIt... you can 
just uses the JS code as-is.  These instructions exist for developers and anyone 
who wants to delve into the code.

If you just want to use SelectBoxIt, then visit the 
[SelectBoxIt home page](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/) or go to 
the [ReadMe](https://github.com/gfranko/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/blob/master/README.markdown) 
on GitHub.

### Developer tools

SelectBoxIt uses the following development tools:

   - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): For package management and builds.

   - [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com): to run the build script.

   - [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/): unit testing framework.

   - [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org): headless WebKit browser for testing.

### Setting up the developement environment

1. Install Node.js.  Luckily the [Node web site](http://nodejs.org) makes this 
   fairly straightforward, with installers for the major platforms.

2. Perform the core dependency installations by navigating to the root of your
   SelectBoxIt source tree and typing the following on the command line:
    
          npm install
**Note:** If you are on Windows, remember you need to run the grunt command 
using `grunt.cmd`.

3. Install PhantomJS from its [home page](http://phantomjs.org).  This means 
   downloading the appropriate file, uncompressing it, and then copying the 
   `phantomjs` file to a location in your path.  On MacOSX, this looks 
   _something_ like the following after downloading:

          cd /usr/local/bin
          sudo cp ~/Downloads/phantomjs-1.8.1-macosx/bin/phantomjs .
